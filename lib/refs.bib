Internet of Thing (IoT) technology enables the manufacturer to track gray-product distribution and monitor gray market activity. In this paper, we aim to introduce IoT technology into gray market management and investigate the impact of IoT technology on gray market and firms' profits. First, we design an IoT-based traceability system which realizes the real-time monitoring of gray market activity. Based on the IoT-based traceability system, then we consider the manufacturer's two coping strategies and establish three game models to examine how IoT technology affects gray market and firms’ profits. Finally, we present the numerical simulations to perfect and supplement our findings. We find that IoT technology has significant implications which can inhibit gray market. However, it is not always beneficial to the manufacturer or harmful to the retailer. If the manufacturer takes an appropriate coping strategy, a win-win situation can be achieved. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

It also identifies the role of collaborative innovation as a catalyst in these relationships. Survey data from Japanese manufacturing companies was examined using hierarchical multiple regression analysis to test the study's hypotheses. According to the results, collaborative innovation with SC members, that is, suppliers and customers, strengthens the impact of digital transformation on adaptability, but not on efficiency. In contrast, collaborative innovation with market participants, such as competitors and partners, reinforces the positive relationship between digital transformation and efficiency, with no evidence supporting its effect on the innovation-adaptability relationship. These findings encourage firms to widen the scope of their collaborative innovation activities to include different types of partners. For firms with limited abilities to conduct such complex collaboration projects, the findings can assist managers in making well-informed decisions to include partners that accommodate prioritized organizational goals. © Abdalla, S., Nakagawa, K. 2021.

Notwithstanding, we have as yet limited understanding of how organizations translate its potential into actual social and economic value. We conduct an in-depth systematic review of IS literature on the topic and identify six debates central to how organizations realize value from big data, at different levels of analysis. Based on this review, we identify two socio-technical features of big data that influence value realization: portability and interconnectivity. We argue that, in practice, organizations need to continuously realign work practices, organizational models, and stakeholder interests in order to reap the benefits from big data. We synthesize the findings by means of an integrated model.}

ABSTRACT = {The introduction of information technology into all aspects of our lives has brought forth qualitative and quantitative changes on such a large scale that this process has come to be known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0. The aim of this paper is to fill in the gaps and provide an overview of studies dealing with Industry 4.0 from the business and economic perspectives. A scoping review is performed regarding business, microeconomic and macroeconomic economic problems. Four investigators performed a literature search of the Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct. The selected period spanned from 2014 to 2018, and the following keywords were used for the search: Industry 4.0, economics, economic development, production economics, and financial sector. A total of 2275 results were returned. In all, 67 full papers were screened. Results obtained from the relevant studies were, furthermore, divided into the following categories: work and skills development; economy growth and macroeconomic aspect; sustainability; intelligent manufacturing; policy; and change in business processes. Findings show that the aspects of work and skills development, smart technology adoption, intelligent manufacturing, and digitalization are very well described. The government and its policies usually play the role of a needed supportive element. Usually studies lack a coherent view of the topic in question and solve partial questions.},

abstract={The advent of the Industry 4.0 initiative has made it so that manufacturing environments are becoming more and more dynamic, connected but also inherently more complex, with additional inter-dependencies, uncertainties and large volumes of data being generated. Recent advances in Industrial Artificial Intelligence have showcased the potential of this technology to assist manufacturers in tackling the challenges associated with this digital transformation of Cyber-Physical Systems, through its data-driven predictive analytics and capacity to assist decision-making in highly complex, non-linear and often multistage environments. However, the industrial adoption of such solutions is still relatively low beyond the experimental pilot stage, as real environments provide unique and difficult challenges for which organizations are still unprepared. The aim of this paper is thus two-fold. First, a systematic review of current Industrial Artificial Intelligence literature is presented, focusing on its application in real manufacturing environments to identify the main enabling technologies and core design principles. Then, a set of key challenges and opportunities to be addressed by future research efforts are formulated along with a conceptual framework to bridge the gap between research in this field and the manufacturing industry, with the goal of promoting industrial adoption through a successful transition towards a digitized and data-driven company-wide culture. This paper is among the first to provide a clear definition and holistic view of Industrial Artificial Intelligence in the Industry 4.0 landscape, identifying and analysing its fundamental building blocks and ongoing trends. Its findings are expected to assist and empower researchers and manufacturers alike to better understand the requirements and steps necessary for a successful transition into Industry 4.0 supported by AI, as well as the challenges that may arise during this process.},  keywords={},

The importance of human–machine interfaces (HMIs) has been increasing due to the complexity of the current manufacturing context. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and understand HMIs in smart factories from a holistic perspective, which enables us to understand the overall picture. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of HMIs to identify smart factory functions, tasks, information types, interaction modalities, and their impact on human operators from the perspectives of human factors and human–computer interaction. Seventy-seven articles were selected for SLR and analysed based on three research questions. We found four smart factory functions (operation and supervision, management, maintenance service, and cybersecurity) consisting of 18 tasks, including subtasks and functions. The effects of these functions, tasks, and HMIs on human operators are also discussed. Five interaction modalities (gaze, voice, gesture, tactile, and haptic) were used to perform these functions and tasks. This paper also discusses the practical use context of HMIs in smart factories and offers HMI recommendations for users, designers, and researchers. These findings provide insights into the design of HMIs in smart factories.}

However, we need to consider security inherent in existing (stand-alone) devices and networks as well as those that may arise in such integrations. Especially the existing solutions are insufficient to address these fundamental security concerns. Thus, we present a blockchain-based system for secure mutual authentication, BSeIn, to enforce fine-grained access control polices. The proposed system (with integrated attribute signature, multi-receivers encryption and message authentication code) is designed to provide privacy and security guarantees such as anonymous authentication, auditability, and confidentiality. BSeIn also scales well due to the utilization of smart contract. We then evaluate the security and performance of BSeIn. For example, findings from the performance evaluation demonstrate that Initialization/Request Issuance/Chain Transaction/State Delivery/Permission Update phase only cost 12.123/4.810/6.978/0.013/2.559s, respectively.}

The present paper describes the context of the extension of mechatronic systems to cyber-physical ones, firstly by highlighting their similarities and differences, and then by underlining the current needs for CPSs in the manufacturing sector. Then, the paper presents the main research issues related to CPS design and, in particular, the needs for an integrated and multi-scale designing approach to prevent conflicts across different design domains early enough within the CPS development process. To this aim, the impact of the extension from mechatronic to Cyber-Physical Systems on their design is examined through a set of existing related modelling techniques. The multi-scalability requirement of these techniques is firstly described, concerning external/internal interactions, process control, behaviour simulation, representation of topological relationships and interoperability through a multi-agent platform, and then applied to the case study of a tablets manufacturing process. Finally, the proposed holistic description of such a multi-scale manufacturing CPS allows to outline the main characteristics of a modelling-simulation platform, able notably to bridge the semantic gaps existing between the different designing disciplines and specialised domains.}

abstract="Systems do not simply pop into existence. They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to ``normal accidents.'' We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin.",

ABSTRACT = {The manufacturing sector is one of the areas where the advantages of digital twin technology can benefit mostly. The product development, including its software, electronics, mechanics, and physical behavior, is included in the digital twin of the product. Furthermore, simultaneous data capturing from the sensors and data processing are also available in the digital twin. This enables each phase of the development cycle to be simulated, processed, and validated to discover the potential problems before the production of real components. In this study, the use of digital twin technology in the commercial production phase of the automotive production line with a case study is introduced. This study is one of the most comprehensive studies in the literature related to automotive production; therefore, it puts forth the power of using digital twin technology in that area. As the result of this case study, a 6.01 percent increase in the commercial production line efficiency and an 87.56 percent gain for downtime are achieved.},

    abstract = "{The Digital Twin concept represents an innovative method to monitor and predict the performance of an aircraft’s various subsystems. By creating ultra-realistic multi-physical computational models associated with each unique aircraft and combining them with known flight histories, operators could benefit from a real-time understanding of the vehicle’s current capabilities. One important facet of the Digital Twin program is the detection and monitoring of structural damage. Recently, a method to detect fatigue cracks using the transformation response of shape memory alloy (SMA) particles embedded in the aircraft structure has been proposed. By detecting changes in the mechanical and/or electromagnetic responses of embedded particles, operators could detect the onset of fatigue cracks in the vicinity of these particles. In this work, the development of a finite element model of an aircraft wing containing embedded SMA particles in key regions will be discussed. In particular, this model will feature a technique known as substructure analysis, which retains degrees of freedom at specified points key to scale transitions, greatly reducing computational cost. By using this technique to model an aircraft wing subjected to loading experienced during flight, we can simulate the response of these localized particles while also reducing computation time. This new model serves to demonstrate key aspects of this detection technique. Future work, including the determination of the material properties associated with these particles as well as exploring the positioning of these particles for optimal crack detection, is also discussed.}",

First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

RFID devices are deployed systematically on the shop-floor to track and trace manufacturing objects and collect real-time production data. Disturbances are identified and controlled within RT-MES. Planning and scheduling decisions are more practically and precisely made and executed. Online facilities are provided to visualize and manage real-time dynamics of shop-floor WIP (work-in-progress) items. A case study is reported in a collaborating company which manufactures large-scale and heavy-duty machineries.

  abstract={Untimely or uncontrolled release of work orders into production creates variance in production and in turn leads to high work-in-process and increased average throughput time, high conversion rate and unbalanced production line. In the HMLV manufacturing environment (e.g. Precision Engineering industry), the massive product mix, low production quantity, and the multitude of production constraints make it virtually impossible for human beings to manually optimise the correct product mix to be released to the production. In this paper, a work order release system was implemented to bridge the gap between the enterprise planning and shop floor execution. It facilitates the management of the sales order by generating and releasing the work orders into shop floor, considering the finite capacity constraints. It also communicates with the shop floor tracking system during execution of the work orders. Working together, these two systems facilitate the management of unplanned stochastic and dynamic events.},

Additionally, we propose a general algorithm to extract some scene understanding by inverting the monoplotting process and applying it to digital elevation models. This allows us to derive estimations of perspective image areas causing object occlusions. Connecting the real world and perspective spaces, we can create a resilient object tracking environment using both coordinate spaces to adapt tracking methods when objects encounter occlusions. We submit that this novel composite of techniques opens avenues for more intelligent, robust object tracking and detailed environment analysis using GIS in complex spatial domains provided video footage and UAS products.},

              automatic and accurate object data capturing capability and

  abstract={Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an integral part of our life, which increases productivity and convenience. It is the term coined for short-range radio technology used to communicate mainly digital information between a stationary location and a movable object or between movable objects. This RFID system uses the principle of modulated backscatter where it can transfer the data from the tag to the reader. The tag generally reads its internal memory of stored data and changes the loading on the tag antenna in a coded manner corresponding to the stored data. RFID is a technology, which spans systems engineering, software development, encryption etc., and thus there are many engineers involved in the development and application of RFID and at present the shortage of technical and business people trained in RFID is hampering the growth of the industry.},

  abstract={Despite the current challenges and risks in implementation, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is rapidly expanding its application area from simple inventory management to advanced location tracking and supply chain management in a wide range of industries. As RFID technology is widely adopted in the industries, the valuation of RFID investment has become vital for businesses due to its potential impacts on cost, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Because of the lack of analytical methods for measuring the benefits and costs, our study attempts to develop a mathematical approach to the valuation of RFID investment. This study presents the base model for RFID investment decisions in a supply chain management setting and enhances the model to help make budget allocation decisions for businesses with multiple sites under budgetary constraints. Our model provides a basis for our understanding of RFID value creation and ways to build an RFID business case for an RFID investment justification.},

This paper specifically explores the impact of such developments on manufacturing shop floor control, examining the way in which both conventional control methods and so-called distributed, intelligent control methods can be enhanced by the availability of accurate, timely information about an item. In the case of distributed, intelligent manufacturing control we begin to build a specification for the concept of an intelligent product—a product whose information content is permanently bound to its material content and which is able to influence decisions made about it.}

	abstract = {This edition of Digital Image Processing is a major revision of the book. As in the 1977 and 1987 editions by Gonzalez and Wintz, and the 1992, 2002, and 2008 editions by Gonzalez and Woods, this sixth-generation edition was prepared with students and instructors in mind. The principal objectives of the book continue to be to provide an introduction to basic concepts and methodologies applicable to digital image processing, and to develop a foundation that can be used as the basis for further study and research in this field.

To achieve these objectives, we focused again on material that we believe is fundamental and whose scope of application is not limited to the solution of specialized problems. The mathematical complexity of the book remains at a level well within the grasp of college seniors and first-year graduate students who have introductory preparation in mathematical analysis, vectors, matrices, probability, statistics, linear systems, and computer programming. The book website provides tutorials to support readers needing a review of this background material.

One of the principal reasons this book has been the world leader in its field for 40 years is the level of attention we pay to the changing educational needs of our readers. The present edition is based on an extensive survey that involved faculty, students, and independent readers of the book in 150 institutions from 30 countries. The survey revealed a need for coverage of new material that has matured since the last edition of the book. The principal findings of the survey indicated a need for:

New material related to histogram matching.
Expanded coverage of the fundamentals of spatial filtering.
A more comprehensive and cohesive coverage of image transforms.
A more complete presentation of finite differences, with a focus on edge detection.
A discussion of clustering, superpixels, and their use in region segmentation.
New material on active contours that includes snakes and level sets, and their use in image segmentation.
Coverage of maximally stable extremal regions.
Expanded coverage of feature extraction to include the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT).
Expanded coverage of neural networks to include deep neural networks, backpropagation, deep learning, and, especially, deep convolutional neural networks.
More homework problems at the end of the chapters.
MATLAB computer projects.
The new and reorganized material that resulted in the present edition is our attempt at providing a reasonable balance between rigor, clarity of presentation, and the findings of the survey. In addition to new material, earlier portions of the text were updated and clarified. This edition contains 425 new images, 135 new drawings, and 220 new exercises. For the first time, we have included MATLAB projects at the end of every chapter. In total there are 120 new MATLAB projects that cover a broad range of the material in the book. Although the solutions we provide are in MATLAB, the projects themselves are written in such a way that they can be implemented in other languages. Projects are an important addition because they will allow students to experiment with material they learn in the classroom. A large database of digital images is provided for this purpose.},

The correspondence between the resulting cubic spline functions and Gaussian functions was first shown by Poggio. The impulse response arising from cubic spline approximation is however not positive everywhere. As an alternative, approximating cubic splines under tension are considered in this paper and a fast implementation is proposed that requires the same amount of calculations for all values of the spread. The performance (approximation error versus computational efficiency) is compared with that of single- and multi-stage FIR Gaussian filter approximations.
Zusammenfassung
Eine angenäherte Gauβsche Filterung äquidistanter Daten kann über eine Regularisierung der Daten mit Hilfe Tikhonovs stabilisierenden Funktionalen zweiter Ordnung erreicht werden. Poggio hat zuerst den Zusammenhang zwischen kubischen Splines und den Gauβ-Funktionen herausgestellt. Die Impulsantwort, die man bei der Approximation mit kubischen Splines erhält, ist jedoch nicht überall positiv. Als Alternative werden kubische Splines unter Spannung betrachtet und eine günstige Implementierung bei gleichem Rechenaufwand vorgeschlagen. Die Güte (Approximationsfehler gegen Rechenaufwand) wird mit ein- bzw. mehrstufigen Gauβschen Filterapproximationen verglichen.
Résumé
Le filtrage gaussien approché de données équidistantes peut être obtenu en régularisant les données avec les fonctionnelles de stabilisation de deuxième ordre de Tikhonov. La correspondance entre les fonctions splines cubiques et les fonctions gaussiennes a été montrée pour la première fois par Poggio. La réponse impulsionnelle découlant de l'approximation par spline cubique n'est toutefois pas positive partout. Comme alternative, on considère dans cet article des splines cubiques d'approximation, tendues, qui nécessitent le même nombre de calcul pour toutes les valeurs de l'étendue. La performance (l'erreur de l'approximation en fonction de l'efficacité de calcul) est comparée avec celles d'approximations par filtres gaussiens à un ou plusieurs niveaux.}

  abstract={This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

As a rising star of server software, Nginx is famous for its high concurrent processing capability, while its performance and scalability are excellent. The load balancing and web cache solution in some typical cases were studied in this paper, and focus on how to design solutions combined with the Nginx and its modules. A virtual Discuz BBS application server cluster environment is designed according to the topology in real network, together with a set of corresponding load balancing and Web caching optimization solution are designed and simulated. Through the analysis of the simulation result, we find that the solution based on Nginx is very significant. It proves that solutions based on Nginx for load balance and Web cache are not only feasible, but also very suitable and efficient for deployment in high concurrent environment.},

Instead of bundles of special code for this, ORM encourages models and use of constraints for the application, which then runs in a context set up by the ORM. Today's web applications are particularly well-suited to this approach, as they are necessarily multithreaded and thus are prone to race conditions unless the interaction with the database is very carefully implemented. The ORM approach was first realized in Hibernate, an open source project for Java systems started in 2002, and this year is joined by Microsoft's Entity Data Model for .NET systems. Both are described here.},

abstract = {People are usually asked by enterprises and other organizations to disclose their personal information to access web services and engage in business interactions. Enterprises need this information to enable their business processes. This is unlikely to change, at least in the foreseeable future. When collecting personal data, enterprises must satisfy privacy laws and policies along with addressing people's expectations on how their data should be handled. Currently much is done by means of manual processes, in particular in terms of privacy enforcement: these processes are prone to mistakes and hard to comply with. Automation can help enterprises to deal with these privacy management issues, in particular the enforcement of privacy policies on collected personal data. Enterprises have already been investing in identity management solutions: they require that approaches to automate privacy management should keep into account and leverage these solutions. This paper discusses our research and development work to automate the enforcement of privacy policies in enterprises. Our model of privacy policy enforcement is introduced along with the technical details of a related prototype, integrated (as a proof of concept) with HP Select Access, a state-of-the-art identity management solution. This technology is currently under productisation. We discuss our current results and next steps.},

	abstract = {NGSI-LD introduces a standardized mechanism for persisting and retrieving historical context data. Conventionally, context brokers only deal with current context - they have no memory, however NGSI-LD context brokers can be extended to offer historical context data in a variety of JSON based formats. Temporal functions are classified as an optional interface for NGSI-LD context brokers, since the additional functionality comes at a cost, and is not mandatory by default for performance reasons.

Context broker with the temporal interface enabled can persist historic context using the database of their choice. The NGSI-LD temporal interface is agnostic to the actual persistence mechanism to be used by the context broker - the interface merely specifies the outputs required when various queries take place. Furthermore, NGSI-LD also specifies a mechanism for amending values of historic context using the instanceId attribute.

The result is a series of data points timestamped using the observedAt property-of-a-property. Each time-stamped data point represents the state of context entities at a given moment in time. The individual data points are not particularly useful on their own, it is only through combining a series data points that meaningful statistics such as maxima, minima and trends can be observed.

The creation and analysis of trend data is a common requirement of context-driven systems. Within FIWARE, there are two common paradigms in use - either activating the temporal interface or subscribing to individual context entities and persisting them into a time-series database (using a component such as QuantumLeap) - the latter is described in a separate tutorial.

Which mechanism to use should be it should be borne in mind when architecting such a system. The advantage of using a subscription mechanism is that only the subscribed entities are persisted, saving disk space. The advantage of the temporal interface is that it is provided by the context broker directly - no subscriptions are needed and HTTP traffic is reduced. Furthermore, the temporal interface can be queried across all context entities, not merely those which satisfy a subscription.},

abstract = {As the amount of data and devices on the Web experiences exponential growth issues on how to integrate such hugely heterogeneous components into a scalable system become increasingly important. REST has proven to be a viable solution for such large-scale information systems. It provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, result in benefits in terms of loose coupling, maintainability, evolvability, and scalability. Unfortunately, some of REST's constraints such as the ones that demand self-descriptive messages or require the use of hypermedia as the engine of application state are rarely implemented correctly. This results in tightly coupled and thus brittle systems. To solve these and other issues, we present JSON-LD, a community effort to standardize a media type targeted to machine-to-machine communication with inherent hypermedia support and rich semantics. Since JSON-LD is 100\% compatible with traditional JSON, developers can continue to use their existing tools and libraries. As we show in the paper, JSON-LD can be used to build truly RESTful services that, at the same time, integrate the exposed data into the Semantic Web. The required additional design costs are significantly outweighed by the achievable benefits in terms of loose coupling, evolvability, scalability, self-descriptiveness, and maintainability.},

JSON Schema is an attempt to provide a general purpose schema language for JSON, but it is still work in progress, and the formal specification has not yet been agreed upon. Why this could be a problem becomes evident when examining the behaviour of numerous tools for validating JSON documents against this initial schema proposal: although they agree on most general cases, when presented with the greyer areas of the specification they tend to differ significantly. In this paper we provide the first formal definition of syntax and semantics for JSON Schema and use it to show that implementing this layer on top of JSON is feasible in practice. This is done both by analysing the theoretical aspects of the validation problem and by showing how to set up and validate a JSON Schema for Wikidata, the central storage for Wikimedia.},

In the transform domain, invariant descriptions of visual objects can be derived to serve as the basic sets required for pattern recognition and memory.

	abstract = {The FIWARE NGSI v2 information model has been evolved to better support linked data (entity relationships), property graphs and semantics (exploiting the capabilities offered by JSON-LD). This work has been conducted under the ETSI ISG CIM initiative and has been branded as NGSI-LD. The main constructs of NGSI-LD are: Entity, Property and Relationship. NGSI-LD Entities (instances) can be the subject of Properties or Relationships. In terms of the traditional NGSI v2 data model, Properties can be seen as the combination of an attribute and its value. Relationships allow to establish associations between instances using linked data. In practice, they are conveyed by means of a special NGSI v2 attribute with a special value (relationship’s object), which happens to be a URI which points to another entity. They are similar to the ref attributes recommended by the Data Models guidelines.

Properties and Relationships can be the subject of other Properties or Relationships. Thus, in the NGSI-LD information model there are no attribute’s metadata, but just “properties of properties” or “properties of relationships”. It is not expected to have infinite graphs, and in practice, only one or two levels of Property or Relationship “chaining” will happen. Typically, there will be one, equivalent to the NGSI v2 metadata abstraction. NGSI-LD Entities are represented using JSON-LD, a JSON-based serialization format for Linked Data. The main advantage of JSON-LD is that it offers the capability of expanding JSON terms to URIs, so that vocabularies can be used to define terms unambiguously.},

  abstract={NoSQL databases systems are non-relational databases uniquely intended to give high accessibility, reliability, and scalability for enormous data. Additionally sharding is the main fundamental favorable circumstances of NoSQL database. Various companies are moving towards NoSQL databases. NoSQL databases can store unstructured data such as email, multimedia, documents, and social media with high performance. NoSQL document stored database, MongoDB has many security risks which can be overcome by a good secure cryptographic system. In this paper, we will use symmetric cryptographic techniques for providing the security (confidentiality) of unstructured data in NoSQL document stored MongoDB. DES, AES, and blowfish algorithms with random key generation are used to encrypt/decrypt the document data before storing/retrieving to/from the NoSQL MongoDB database. We have also provided the comparative analysis of execution time taken by each algorithm with MongoDB for different size of data. There arises a problem that the storage size taken by the encrypted data in MongoDB database is more as compared to the original data. To solve this problem, we used a zlib compression technique to reduce the storage size taken by the encrypted data and provide comparative results.},

This is possible if the system utilizes more than one web server to serve requests from users. Load Balancing makes web application performance better when more than one server is used. This can improve the efficiency of the results created by the server, and reduce the traffic load from a single server and distribute the traffic load to all servers connected to load balancer. In this study a load balancing performance review will be carried out on HAProxy and Nginx by implementing the Round-robin algorithm on both load balancing servers.

abstract = {In recent years, new types of interactive analytical dashboard features have emerged for operational decision support systems (DSS). Analytical components of such features solve optimization problems hidden from the human eye, whereas interactive components involve the individual in the optimization process via graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite their expected value for organizations, little is known about the effectiveness of interactive analytical dashboards in operational DSS or their influences on human cognitive abilities. This paper contributes to the closing of this gap by exploring and empirically testing the effects of interactive analytical dashboard features on situation awareness (SA) and task performance in operational DSS. Using the theoretical lens of SA, we develop hypotheses about the effects of a what-if analysis as an interactive analytical dashboard feature on operational decision-makers' SA and task performance. The resulting research model is studied with a laboratory experiment, including eye-tracking data of 83 participants. Our findings show that although a what-if analysis leads to higher task performance, it may also reduce SA, nourishing a potential out-of-the-loop problem. Thus, designers and users of interactive analytical dashboards have to carefully mitigate these effects in the implementation and application of operational DSS. In this article, we translate our findings into implications for designing dashboards within operational DSS to help practitioners in their efforts to address the danger of the out-of-the-loop syndrome.}

Hence, interest in dashboards has increased recently, which is also evident from the proliferation of dashboard solution providers in the market. Despite dashboards' popularity, little is known about the extent of their effectiveness, i.e. what types of dashboards work best for different users or tasks. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive multidisciplinary literature review with an aim to identify the critical issues organizations might need to consider when implementing dashboards. Dashboards are likely to succeed and solve the problems of presentation format and information load when certain visualization principles and features are present (e.g. high data-ink ratio and drill down features). We recommend that dashboards come with some level of flexibility, i.e. allowing users to switch between alternative presentation formats. Also some theory driven guidance through pop-ups and warnings can help users to select an appropriate presentation format. Given the dearth of research on dashboards, we conclude the paper with a research agenda that could guide future studies in this area.}

Experimental results under Borland C++ Builder 6.0 show that OpenCV based fabric defect detection methods are simple, high code integration, accurate defects positioning, which can be applied to develop real-time fabric defect detection system.},

  abstract={Traffic sign recognition is studied as one of the modern assistance in driving. The main purpose of it is to help driver on realizing traffic sign around the car by using computer vision enhanced to the car. In this paper, a combination method of Color-based Method and SVM is presented to do the traffic sign recognition. Color-based Method with CIELab + hue is chosen because it gives good result on localizing traffic signs. It is first used to preprocess the image to binary image. The binary image is then processed with canny to give more accurate result on detecting traffic signs. To get the traffic sign shape, the preprocessed image is checked by using Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm, this algorithm will approximate each closed object shape in the preprocessed image. Detecting closed object make it unable to detect occluded and attached road signs. In order to detect occluded and attached signs, the proposed method will use two phase of detection by estimating the shape of the arc or later called the shape-arc algorithm. Approximated circle, square, or triangle images will be marked as traffic sign and processed in the recognition step with linear c-SVM. SVM classification will be based on binary images which gives 97\% accuracy. The proposed method is more accurate than methods proposed by the reference papers and the detection is able to detect harder problems such as attached signs.},

Three main contributions are presented. First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem.}

Development of client server applications on technologies, like IoT based, cloud based, and smart homes systems are growing rapidly in the current technology era. User authentication is important concern in these applications. REST (Representational State Transfer) based architecture with JWT emerged enormously in recent development of client server applications. JWTs (JSON Web Token) is used for authentication of subsequent client requests without making frequent calls to the resource server or database. In this paper, we present an authentication technique for regeneration of JWT on each client request based on truly random timestamp values to enhance the authenticity of client on server. The working of proposed technique is elaborated with a case study which indicates the stronger authentication and security.},

abstract = {This paper shows that existing definitions of code-injection attacks (e.g., SQL-injection attacks) are flawed. The flaws make it possible for attackers to circumvent existing mechanisms, by supplying code-injecting inputs that are not recognized as such. The flaws also make it possible for benign inputs to be treated as attacks. After describing these flaws in conventional definitions of code-injection attacks, this paper proposes a new definition, which is based on whether the symbols input to an application get used as (normal-form) values in the application's output. Because values are already fully evaluated, they cannot be considered "code" when injected. This simple new definition of code-injection attacks avoids the problems of existing definitions, improves our understanding of how and when such attacks occur, and enables us to evaluate the effectiveness of mechanisms for mitigating such attacks.},

  abstract={With the growing realization that current Internet protocols are reaching the limits of their senescence, several on-going research efforts aim to design potential next-generation Internet architectures. Although they vary in maturity and scope, in order to avoid past pitfalls, these efforts seek to treat security and privacy as fundamental requirements. Resilience to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks that plague today's Internet is a major issue for any new architecture and deserves full attention. In this paper, we focus on DoS in Named Data Networking (NDN) -- a specific candidate for next-generation Internet architecture designs. By naming data instead of its locations, NDN transforms data into a first-class entity and makes itself an attractive and viable approach to meet the needs for many current and emerging applications. It also incorporates some basic security features that mitigate classes of attacks that are commonly seen today. However, NDN's resilience to DoS attacks has not been analyzed to-date. This paper represents a first step towards assessment and possible mitigation of DoS in NDN. After identifying and analyzing several new types of attacks, it investigates their variations, effects and counter-measures. This paper also sheds some light on the debate about relative virtues of self-certifying, as opposed to human-readable, names in the context of content-centric networking.},

In this paper, ping of death as a cyber security attack is modeled for IoT networks. Attackers increase the length of transmit packets intentionally in order to degrade the network resources. To mitigate ping of death attacks, an intrusion detection system (IDS) is designed to be included in the network gateway to detect attacks and to filter out the over-length packets. The IDS relies on an integer optimization problem minimizing the false alarm probability while maintaining the missed detection probability below a desired level. The problem is solved using a search method. Simulation results demonstrate the impact of the proposed IDS by not allowing the gateway queue lengths to grow unexpectedly and to maintain queues at a normal level. Furthermore, simulation results provide a guideline for the network administrator to configure the IDS parameters such a normal packet length.},

    abstract = { The A/E/C industry is the largest US industry. It forms about ten percent of the dollar value of the US GNP, with a total annual volume for new construction exceeding \$500 billion. Many of these projects are plagued with delays, over-expenditures, design changes, and other unexpected conditions jeopardizing the smooth and timely completion of the project. Regular and accurate reporting on project progress offers a continuous vital diagnosis of the project status, enabling different project team-members to make proper decisions on any necessary corrective actions to safeguard the project and ensure its completion. This paper discusses a new interactive multimedia system that can be used by different project team-members to document and report progress in construction projects, as well as a tool to analyze this progress and help predict the final project outcome. The interactive multimedia approach was selected to minimize the paperwork, provide timely update, and ensure a safe and easy method for document storage and retrieval. This research aimed at developing a practical and applicable tool to serve as a model of the sought interaction between academia and industry in the field of construction research and practice. This tool representing the project progress report can be distributed in the form of an interactive multimedia CD, summarizing the actual progress for the past reporting period as well as expected projections for the remaining part of the project. A web site for intra-period updates supplements this CD, allowing for information dissemination and exchange within the reporting period }

ABSTRACT = {Traceability of natural resources, from the cradle to the final product is a crucial issue to secure sustainable material usage as well as to optimize and control processes over the whole supply chain. In the forest products industries the material can be tracked by different technologies, but for the first step of material flow, from the forest to the industry, no systematic and complete technology has been developed. On the way to close this data gap the fingerprint technology for wooden logs looks promising. It uses inherent properties of a wood stem for identification. In this paper hyperspectral cameras are applied to gain images of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) log end faces in different spectral ranges. The images are converted to a biometric template of feature vectors and a matching algorithm is used to evaluate if the biometric templates are similar or not. Based on this, matching scores specific spectral ranges which contain information to distinguish between different log end faces are identified. The method developed in this paper is a necessary and successful step to define scanning system parameters for fingerprint recognition systems for wood log traceability from the forest.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={88552-88563},
  abstract={Tracking of the wood product is an important technology in the trade activity of rare plants. Normally, the factories use Quick Response (QR) and Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) to identify the individual wood product, but these technologies are not safe enough because they can be easily falsified. It can be seen that traditional methods are hard to catch the detail of the slim wood texture from the wood product. In this study, a novel method is employed to resolve these problems using a biometric feature on the surface of the real wood product to distinguish the individual wood product. AKAZE is used to extract the key-point of wood texture. A sub-area detection technique along with a serialization method is then developed to improve the rate of identification. The sub-area detection technique deals with picking out a sub-region in which there are enough AKAZE points as small as possible. The serialization method is also utilized to reduce the redundant process of feature extraction. The experimental results demonstrate that the values of accuracy, recall, and  $F1$  reach 0.98, 0.96, and 0.96, respectively. The match time that uses serialized function is reduced to 1/3 of which has no application in the original image. The validated results also reveal that our proposed methodology improves the robustness of the wood product identification, and it can be used in Wood Traceability System (WTS) with the blockchain to resolve the digital trust problem and the fast distinction issues of the real wood product.},
