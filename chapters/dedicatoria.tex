I would like to dedicate this work to my parents, Ana Maria Capitanio and Flavio Capitanio. It is thanks to their unwavering support and encouragement that my dream of studying abroad became a reality. Their love, guidance, and sacrifices have been instrumental in shaping my academic journey, and I am deeply grateful for their constant belief in me. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them, and I am forever thankful for their presence in my life.
